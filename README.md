# 🎸 FPGA Guitar Synthesizer with Karplus–Strong & VGA Visualization

This repository documents an **FPGA-based digital guitar synthesizer** implemented as a hardware design project.  
Due to course and academic integrity policies, the **source code is not publicly shared**.  
Instead, this repository contains the **final presentation, system architecture, and lab demonstration images**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time digital guitar** on an FPGA using **physical modeling synthesis** and synchronized **visual feedback**.

### The system:
- Generates realistic plucked-string audio using the **Karplus–Strong algorithm**
- Displays a guitar with **6 animated vibrating strings** via VGA
- Accepts real-time user input through a **PS/2 keyboard**
- Synchronizes **audio output and VGA animation** entirely in hardware

All components run **fully on the FPGA in real time**.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The design is **fully modular and hardware-driven**.

### Key Subsystems

#### PS/2 Input System
- Reads keyboard scancodes
- Keys `1–6` select guitar strings
- `Spacebar` triggers a pluck
- Ensures only one string plays at a time

#### Karplus–Strong Audio Core
Physical modeling synthesis using:
- Circular delay-line buffer
- Noise burst (pluck)
- Averaging low-pass filter  

Produces realistic, naturally decaying string vibration.

#### Audio Output System
- Real-time audio mixing
- FPGA audio controller + DAC interface
- Synchronized playback with VGA visuals

#### VGA Visualization
- 640×480 static guitar background (MIF image)
- Animated string vibration per pluck
- Animation decays naturally with sound

> A full block diagram and FSM breakdown are included in the presentation.

## 🧩 Engineering Challenges Solved

- Prevented unintended retriggering when switching strings mid-decay
- Tuned string frequencies through empirical testing for realistic tone
- Achieved human-visible vibration speeds on VGA via precise timing control
- Precisely positioned strings on a complex background image
- Debugged and verified timing across **audio + VGA pipelines**

## 🚀 Future Extensions

- Dynamic pitch control across a full virtual fretboard
- PS/2 mouse scroll wheel for:
  - Pluck intensity
  - Volume control
- Polyphonic playback (multiple strings simultaneously)
- MIDI input support
